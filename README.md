# CL-BUNNY [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cl-rabbit/cl-bunny.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/cl-rabbit/cl-bunny) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/cl-rabbit/cl-bunny/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/cl-rabbit/cl-bunny?branch=master)
CL-BUNNY is a RabbitMQ client. CL-BUNNY is based on [cl-rabbit](https://github.com/lokedhs/cl-rabbit) and inspired by [bunny](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/bunny).
**Please use with caution - work in progress, API is not stable, error-handling almost non-existent**. **Contributions are greatly appreciated!**

## Installation Notes
CL-BUNNY as well as some of its dependencies are not included in Quicklisp:
* [safe-queue](https://github.com/deadtrickster/safe-queue)
* [eventfd](https://github.com/deadtrickster/eventfd)

While we are working hard to merge our `cl-rabbit` patches to the main repo
please use this [branch](https://github.com/deadtrickster/cl-rabbit/tree/master1).<br>
Make sure you are using the latest version of [librabbitmq](https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c). At least Ubuntu dists usually
ship very outdated version. Just build it youself if not sure.

Also please use `master` branch of [quri](https://github.com/fukamachi/quri)
until all bug fixes not included in Quicklisp release.

If you are on sbcl and experiencing something like dsecribed [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32897952/sending-messages-to-rabbit-mq-using-lisp-inside-a-docker-container)
```
CORRUPTION WARNING in SBCL pid 29643(tid 140737353938688):
Memory fault at 0x7ffff1ef80e0 (pc=0x7ffff25b48fd, sp=0x7ffff2dced00)
The integrity of this image is possibly compromised.

debugger invoked on a SB-SYS:MEMORY-FAULT-ERROR in thread
#<THREAD "main thread" RUNNING {100504E593}>:
  Unhandled memory fault at #x7FFFF1EF80E0.
```
Try to compile sbcl with statically linked librabbitmq first.
To do this you can go to src/runtime/GNUmakefile and
make sure LINKFLAGS line looks like this: 
```
LINKFLAGS = -g  -Wl,--whole-archive <YOUR PATH TO LIBRABBITMQ>/librabbitmq.a -Wl,--no-whole-archive -lcrypto -lssl
```


## Examples
#### Foreword
To run examples you need to have RabbitMQ installed on `localhost` with
* vhost `/`
* user named `guest` with password `guest`.

If you are new to RabbitMQ you may find the following links useful:
* [Install on Debian/Ubuntu](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-debian.html)
* [Access Control](https://www.rabbitmq.com/access-control.html)
* [RabbitMQ Management plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html)


#### Hello World!

```lisp
(defun hello-world ()
  (with-connection ("amqp://" :one-shot t)
    (with-channel ()
      (let ((x (default-exchange)))
        (->
          (queue.declare "cl-bunny.examples.hello-world" :auto-delete t)
          (subscribe (lambda (message)
                       (log:info "Received ~a"
                                 (babel:octets-to-string (message-body message))))))
        (publish x "Hello world!" :routing-key "cl-bunny.examples.hello-world"))
      (sleep 1))))
```
#### Headers exchange (sugar-free)

```lisp
(with-connection ("amqp://" :one-shot t)
  (with-channel ()
    (let ((x (amqp-exchange-declare "headers" :type "headers"))
          (q1 (amqp-queue-declare "" :exclusive t))
          (q2 (amqp-queue-declare "" :exclusive t)))
      (amqp-queue-bind q1 :exchange x :arguments '(("os" . "linux")
                                                   ("cores" . 8)
                                                   ("x-match" . "all")))
      (amqp-queue-bind q2 :exchange x :arguments '(("os" . "osx")
                                                   ("cores" . 4)
                                                   ("x-match" . "any")))

      (subscribe q1 (lambda (message)
                      (log:info "~a received ~a"
                                q1 (babel:octets-to-string (message-body message)))))
      (subscribe q2 (lambda (message)
                      (log:info "~a received ~a"
                                q2 (babel:octets-to-string (message-body message)))))

      (amqp-basic-publish "8 cores/Linux" :exchange x
                                          :properties '((:headers . (("os" . "linux")

      (amqp-basic-publish "4 cores/Linux" :exchange x
                                          :properties '((:headers . (("os" . "linux")
                                                                     ("cores" . 4)))))
