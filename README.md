# CL-BUNNY [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cl-rabbit/cl-bunny.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/cl-rabbit/cl-bunny) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/cl-rabbit/cl-bunny/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/cl-rabbit/cl-bunny?branch=master)
CL-BUNNY is a RabbitMQ client. CL-BUNNY is based on [cl-rabbit](https://github.com/lokedhs/cl-rabbit) and inspired by [bunny](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/bunny).
**Please use with caution - work in progress, error-handling not so descriptive, API is not always stable**. **Contributions are greatly appreciated!**

## Installation Notes
CL-BUNNY as well as some of its dependencies are not included in Quicklisp:
* [safe-queue](https://github.com/deadtrickster/safe-queue)
* [cl-events](https://github.com/deadtrickster/cl-events)

While we are working hard to merge our `cl-rabbit` patches to the main repo
please use this [branch](https://github.com/deadtrickster/cl-rabbit/tree/master1).<br>
Make sure you are using the latest version of [librabbitmq](https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c). At least Ubuntu dists usually
ship very outdated version. Just build it youself if not sure.

If you are on sbcl and experiencing something like reported [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32897952/sending-messages-to-rabbit-mq-using-lisp-inside-a-docker-container)
```
CORRUPTION WARNING in SBCL pid 29643(tid 140737353938688):
Memory fault at 0x7ffff1ef80e0 (pc=0x7ffff25b48fd, sp=0x7ffff2dced00)
The integrity of this image is possibly compromised.
Continuing with fingers crossed.

debugger invoked on a SB-SYS:MEMORY-FAULT-ERROR in thread
#<THREAD "main thread" RUNNING {100504E593}>:
  Unhandled memory fault at #x7FFFF1EF80E0.
```
Try to compile sbcl with statically linked `librabbitmq` and `libffi` first.
To do this you can go to `src/runtime/GNUmakefile` and
make sure LINKFLAGS line looks like this:
```
LINKFLAGS = -g  -Wl,--whole-archive <YOUR PATH TO>/librabbitmq.a <YOUR PATH TO>/libffi.a -Wl,--no-whole-archive -lcrypto -lssl
```


## Examples
#### Foreword
To run examples you need to have RabbitMQ installed on `localhost` with
* vhost `/`
* user named `guest` with password `guest`.

If you are new to RabbitMQ you may find the following links useful:
* [Install on Debian/Ubuntu](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-debian.html)
* [Access Control](https://www.rabbitmq.com/access-control.html)
* [RabbitMQ Management plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html)


#### Hello World!

```lisp
(defun hello-world ()
  (with-connection ()
    (with-channel ()
      (let ((x (exchange.default)))
        (->
          (queue.declare :name "cl-bunny.examples.hello-world" :auto-delete t)
          (subscribe (lambda (message)
                       (log:info "Received ~a"
                                 (message-body-string message)))))
        (publish x "Hello world!" :routing-key "cl-bunny.examples.hello-world"))
      (sleep 1))))
```

####  Error handling
```lisp
(with-connection ()
    (with-channel ()
      (handler-case
          (channel.open)
        (amqp:amqp-error-command-invalid () (print "Can't open already opened channel")))))
```

#### Headers Exchange
```lisp
(with-connection ()
  (with-channel ()
    (let* ((x (exchange.headers "headers" :auto-delete t))
           (q1 (->
                 (queue.declare :exclusive t)
                 (queue.bind x :arguments '(("os" . "linux")
                                            ("cores" . 8)
                                            ("x-match" . "all")))))
           (q2 (->
                 (queue.declare :exclusive t)
                 (queue.bind x :arguments '(("os" . "osx")
                                            ("cores" . 4)
                                            ("x-match" . "any"))))))
      (subscribe q1 (lambda (message)
                      (log:info "~a received ~a" q1 (message-body-string message))))


      (subscribe q2 (lambda (message)
                      (log:info "~a received ~a" q2 (message-body-string message))))

      (->
        x
        (publish "8 cores/Linux" :properties '(:headers (("os" . "linux")
                                                         ("cores" . 8))))
        (publish "8 cores/Linux" :properties '(:headers (("os" . "linux")
                                                         ("cores" . 8))))
        (publish "8 cores/OS X"  :properties '(:headers (("os" . "osx")
                                                         ("cores" . 8))))
        (publish "4 cores/Linux" :properties '(:headers (("os" . "linux")
                                                         ("cores" . 4)))))

      (log:info "Waiting...")
      (sleep 3)
      (log:info "Disconnecting"))))
```
#### Mandatory messages

```lisp
(with-connection ()
  (with-channel ()
    (let* ((x (exchange.default))
           (q (queue.declare :exclusive t)))

      (setf (exchange-on-return-callback x)
            (lambda (returned-message)
              (log:info "Got returned message ~a" (message-body-string returned-message))))

      (subscribe q (lambda (message)                       
                     (log:info "~a received ~a" q (message-body-string message))))

      (publish x "This will NOT be returned" :mandatory t :routing-key q)
      (publish x "This will be returned" :mandatory t
                                         :routing-key (format nil "wefvvtrw~a" (random 10)))        

      (log:info "Waiting...")
      (sleep 3)
      (log:info "Disconnecting"))))
