# CL-BUNNY [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cl-rabbit/cl-bunny.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cl-rabbit/cl-bunny) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/cl-rabbit/cl-bunny/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/cl-rabbit/cl-bunny?branch=master)
CL-BUNNY is a RabbitMQ client. CL-BUNNY is based on [IOLib](https://github.com/sionescu/iolib) and inspired by [bunny](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/bunny) and [pika](https://github.com/pika/pika).
**Please use with caution - work in progress, error-handling not so descriptive, API is not always stable**. **Contributions are greatly appreciated!**

## Installation Notes
CL-BUNNY as well as some of its dependencies are not included in Quicklisp:
* [safe-queue](https://github.com/deadtrickster/safe-queue)
* [cl-events](https://github.com/deadtrickster/cl-events)

## Examples
#### Foreword
To run examples you need to have RabbitMQ installed on `localhost` with
* vhost `/`
* user named `guest` with password `guest`.

If you are new to RabbitMQ you may find the following links useful:
* [Install on Debian/Ubuntu](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-debian.html)
* [Access Control](https://www.rabbitmq.com/access-control.html)
* [RabbitMQ Management plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html)


#### Hello World!

```lisp
(defun hello-world ()
  (with-connection ()
    (with-channel ()
      (let ((x (exchange.default)))
        (->
          (queue.declare :name "cl-bunny.examples.hello-world" :auto-delete t)
          (subscribe (lambda (message)
                       (log:info "Received ~a"
                                 (message-body-string message)))))
        (publish x "Hello world!" :routing-key "cl-bunny.examples.hello-world"))
      (sleep 1))))
```

####  Error handling
```lisp
(with-connection ()
  (with-channel ()
    (handler-case
        (channel.open)
      (connection-closed-error () (print "Can't open already opened channel")))))
-->
<WARN> [17:10:39] bunny iolib-threaded.lisp (channel.receive threaded-iolib-connection amqp-method-connection-close) -
 Connection closed by server: AMQP-ERROR-CHANNEL-ERROR[504, CHANNEL_ERROR - second 'channel.open' seen] in response to AMQP-METHOD-CHANNEL-OPEN
"Can't open already opened channel"
"Can't open already opened channel"
```

#### Headers Exchange
```lisp
(with-connection ()
  (with-channel ()
    (let* ((x (exchange.headers "headers" :auto-delete t))
           (q1 (->
                 (queue.declare :exclusive t)
                 (queue.bind x :arguments '(("os" . "linux")
                                            ("cores" . 8)
                                            ("x-match" . "all")))))
           (q2 (->
                 (queue.declare :exclusive t)
                 (queue.bind x :arguments '(("os" . "osx")
                                            ("cores" . 4)
                                            ("x-match" . "any"))))))
      (subscribe q1 (lambda (message)
                      (log:info "~a received ~a" q1 (message-body-string message))))


      (subscribe q2 (lambda (message)
                      (log:info "~a received ~a" q2 (message-body-string message))))

      (publish x "8 cores/Linux" :properties '(:headers (("os" . "linux")
                                                       ("cores" . 8))))
      (publish x "8 cores/Linux" :properties '(:headers (("os" . "linux")
                                                       ("cores" . 8))))
      (publish x "8 cores/OS X"  :properties '(:headers (("os" . "osx")
                                                       ("cores" . 8))))
      (publish x "4 cores/Linux" :properties '(:headers (("os" . "linux")
                                                       ("cores" . 4))))

      (log:info "Waiting...")
      (sleep 3)
      (log:info "Disconnecting"))))
```
#### Mandatory messages

```lisp
(with-connection ()
  (with-channel ()
    (let* ((x (exchange.default))
           (q (queue.declare :exclusive t)))

      (setf (exchange-on-return-callback x)
            (lambda (returned-message)
              (log:info "Got returned message ~a" (message-body-string returned-message))))

      (subscribe q (lambda (message)                       
                     (log:info "~a received ~a" q (message-body-string message))))

      (publish x "This will NOT be returned" :mandatory t :routing-key q)
      (publish x "This will be returned" :mandatory t
                                         :routing-key (format nil "wefvvtrw~a" (random 10)))        

      (log:info "Waiting...")
      (sleep 3)
      (log:info "Disconnecting"))))
```
