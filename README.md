# CL-BUNNY
CL-BUNNY is a RabbitMQ client. CL-BUNNY is based on [cl-rabbit](https://github.com/lokedhs/cl-rabbit) and inspired by [bunny](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/bunny).
**Please use with caution - work in progress, API is not stable, error-handling almost non-existent**. **Contributions are welcome!**

## Installation Notes
CL-BUNNY as well as some of its dependencies are not included in Quicklisp:
* [safe-queue](https://github.com/deadtrickster/safe-queue)
* [eventfd](https://github.com/deadtrickster/eventfd)

While are working hard to merge our `cl-rabbit` patches to the main repo
please use this [branch](https://github.com/deadtrickster/cl-rabbit/tree/master1).

Also please use `master` branch of [quri](https://github.com/fukamachi/quri)
until all bug fixes not included in Quicklisp release.



## Examples
#### Foreword
To run examples you need to have RabbitMQ installed on `localhost` with
* vhost `/`
* user named `guest` with password `guest`.

If you are new to RabbitMQ you may find the following links useful:

* [RabbitMQ Management plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html)


#### Hello World!

```lisp
(defun hello-world ()
  (with-connection ("amqp://" :one-shot t)
    (with-channel ()
      (let ((x (default-exchange)))
        (->
          (queue.declare "cl-bunny.examples.hello-world" :auto-delete t)
          (subscribe (lambda (message)
                       (log:info "Received ~a"
                                 (babel:octets-to-string (message-body message))))))
        (publish x "Hello world!" :routing-key "cl-bunny.examples.hello-world"))
      (sleep 1))))
```
#### Headers exchange (sugar-free)

```lisp
(with-connection ("amqp://" :one-shot t)
  (with-channel ()
    (let ((x (amqp-exchange-declare "headers" :type "headers"))
          (q1 (amqp-queue-declare "" :exclusive t))
          (q2 (amqp-queue-declare "" :exclusive t)))
      (amqp-queue-bind q1 :exchange x :arguments '(("os" . "linux")
                                                   ("cores" . 8)
                                                   ("x-match" . "all")))
      (amqp-queue-bind q2 :exchange x :arguments '(("os" . "osx")
                                                   ("cores" . 4)
                                                   ("x-match" . "any")))

      (subscribe q1 (lambda (message)

      (amqp-basic-publish "4 cores/Linux" :exchange x
                                          :properties '((:headers . (("os" . "linux")
                                                                     ("cores" . 4)))))
